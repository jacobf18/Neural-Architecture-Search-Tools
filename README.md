# Neural-Architecture-Search-Tools
This repository is a collection of tools to help researchers with Neural Architecture Search.

Tools TODO:
1. Tool to create high-level DAG computational graphs and check their validity for input of any dimensionality (1D images, color images, sequences, etc.)
2. OpenAI Gym to develop better search methods for predetermined datasets.
